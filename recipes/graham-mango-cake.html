        <p>I would describe this dessert as a big hit during fiesta celebration. I always make this on special occasion. It's an easy recipe and most of all you don't even need to bake. Although I love baking but it's nice to have a quick and easy recipe. Most of all, this is a refreshing dessert for the whole family.</p>
